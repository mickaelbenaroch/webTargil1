			In my API, you can make http requests:

			<ul>
				<li>https://targil1part1.herokuapp.com/categories</li>
				<p>This route will is a http GET request that will return you all the categories that are available.<br> 
				<span>Doesn't require ANY PARAMETER</span></p>
				<li>https://targil1part1.herokuapp.com/categories/:category_id</li>
				<p>This route will is a http GET request that will return you a specific category by ID search.<br>
				<span>Here you must pass ONE PARAMETER: "category_id"</span></p>
				<li>https://targil1part1.herokuapp.com/categories/:status/:subject</li>
				<p>This route will is a http GET request that will return you a specific category that one of its subcategries status is the status parameter that you sent and that its subject is the subject that you send in query string.<br>
