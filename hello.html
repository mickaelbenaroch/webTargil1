		<p>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>	
			In this tutorial you will learn about my API functionnality.<br>
			Don't worry it's very easy.<br>
			This API allows you to find Categories of books.<br>
			The Json file contains 3 categories of sort of books:
			recommended books, notsold books and bestseller books.<br>
			Each category has a few properties, in particular has an array of subcategories that contains books by genre.<br>
			For example, in the best seller category, we have subcategories like that each one has an id (e.g "89"), a subject (e.g "action"), a status (e.g "A") and finally  a number of books (e.g "50000");  <br>
			All you have to do is to make a http get/post valid request to get informations. <br> 
			</p><br><br>
